        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS" target="_blank">Cascading
            Style Sheets (CSS)</a> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written
        in a
        markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).CSS is a cornerstone
        technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. This
        separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
        presentation
        characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css
        file,
        which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to
        improve the
        page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

        Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles
        for
        different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader),
        and on
        Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a
        mobile
        device.

        The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than
        one rule
        matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

        The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type)
        text/css
        is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS
        documents.

        In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL. CSS
        is also
        used in the GTK widget toolkit.
