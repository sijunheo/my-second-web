    <h3>Html</h3>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-html" target="_blank">The HyperText Markup Language or HTML
        </a>is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web
        browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as
        Cascading
        Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia web
        pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its
        appearance.

        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
        interactive
        forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
        denoting
        structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML
        elements are
        delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as img and input directly introduce content into
        the
        page. Other tags such as p and /p surround and provide information about document text and may include
        sub-element
        tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.

        HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
        content of
        web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),
        former
        maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over
        explicit
        presentational HTML since 1997. A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio,
        primarily using
        the canvas element, together with JavaScript.
